# Forest-Fires-Prediction
#### There are natural forest fires, but the fire seasons are growing more intense and extensive, especially in tropical rainforests where fires are uncommon and extremely destructive. Forest fires are becoming more frequent, bigger, and more intense as a result of the changing climate and poor land management. Experienced forest departments can check on 3-4 parameters with their human minds, but ML, on the other hand, can handle numerous parameters such as latitude, longitude, satellite, version, and so on, so dealing with this multi-relationship of a parameter that is responsible for a forest fire requires ML. The project predicts whether or not a forest fire will occur based on a number of circumstances.
